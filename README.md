# First_personShootingGame

### How to run and implement:
I suggest to use pycharm to open a local host and check out game_fps.html

Open a local host with python command as the following:

	On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
	On linux or macos, try python3 -m http.server
	If Python version returned above is 2.X, try python -m SimpleHTTPServer
